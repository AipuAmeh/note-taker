# Note-Taker
## Description

In this week's challenge, we used Express.js to add functionality to a note taking application. We practiced retrieving and manipulating data from a JSON file, creating routes to different html pages, data persistence and modularization. 


## Installation

To install this project, you need Express, Fs, and Generate-Unique-ID.

## Usage

To use this note taking app, you can either start the server locally by typing "node server.js" into the terminal and clicking the link, or you can click the heroku link: https://stark-falls-83973.herokuapp.com/

Enter a note by typing into the empty fields and hit the save button to save it onto the page. 

If you want to delete the note, hit the delete button to remove it from the page. Notes are also added and removed in the db.json file.
